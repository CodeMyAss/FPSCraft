 	playerScore = int( (winnerScale * ((gameLength/60) * spm))*(player.timePlayed["total"] / gameLength) );
 	WinnerScale is the multiplier of a win (1x), loss (0.5x), or tie (0.75x).
	GameLength is seconds, so divided by 60, it would scale to minutes. It has a limit of twenty minutes, a match that goes longer than that won't get any more bonus than twenty.
	
	SPM is a measurement based on the player's Rank.
	It uses a really odd equation. The rank multiplied by 0.61 and then adds 1.
	It then takes THAT number, cuts it in half and then adds another 3.
	
	TimePlayed is seconds played, and it is divided by the GameLength. Basically if you are in the server when the match starts and play through to the end, you get 1.
